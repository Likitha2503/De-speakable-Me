# 🟡 DEESPEAKABLE ME – The MinionBot

> 🍌 A banana-powered AI sidekick that talks, thinks, sees, and dances like a true Minion. Built for fun, chaos, and creative exploration.

## 👁️ About the Project

**DEESPEAKABLE ME** is a fully interactive Minion-themed robot built with Raspberry Pi, Python, React, and love (and bananas). It speaks like a Minion, detects faces and objects, responds with AI, and wiggles with servos — all while grinning through animated eyes.
